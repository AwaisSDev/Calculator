# 🔢 Calculator App

A sleek, dark-themed calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This is **Project 2** of my **50 Projects in 50 Days** challenge.

## ✨ Features

- Basic operations: `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`, `%`
- Decimal point and backspace support
- Clean dark UI with hover effects
- Fully responsive design

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling (Flexbox + Grid)
- **JavaScript** – functionality

## 🧠 How It Works

- Button clicks append characters to the input display.
- `eval()` is used to calculate the math expression.
- Backspace removes the last character.
- `C` clears the whole display.
